# Project Title: H1N1 Vaccine Prediction
## Overview:
This project aims to predict whether individuals will obtain the H1N1 vaccine based on various demographic and attitudinal factors. The dataset used in this project contains information about individuals' demographics, opinions about H1N1, awareness, and vaccination status.
## Dependencies:
- Python 3.x

- Jupyter Notebook

- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## Description:
1. The dataset h1n1_vaccine_prediction.csv is loaded into the Jupyter Notebook.

2. Data preprocessing steps are performed to handle missing values and encode categorical variables.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted using various visualizations to understand the distribution and relationships of features.

4. Features are split into training and testing sets.

5. Feature scaling is applied to the dataset.

6. Several machine learning models are implemented and evaluated for prediction:

   - Logistic Regression
  
   - Decision Tree Classifier
  
   - Bagging Classifier
  
   - AdaBoost Classifier
   - Gradient Boosting Classifier
   - Random Forest Classifier

## Result:
The accuracy and classification report for each model are displayed after evaluation.
